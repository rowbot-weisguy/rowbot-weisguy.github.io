Hello! I'm Rowan from Vancouver, Canada. 👋

I love the web. It&rsquo;s the open platform that has connected me with countless
people and ideas. Its potential gets me excited every day! I am here to help
make it even better by:

1. Delivering exceptional user experiences
2. Learning the possibilities and constraints of web technologies
3. Tearing down as many barriers between 1 and 2 as I can

## Background

I studied [interaction design][siat] at SFU, worked at [Mobify][mobify] for
over 2 years in an interdisciplinary marketing team, then left to work as a
contractor. Now I help clients make sure their designs got executed awesomely when
they get to the front-end dev stage.

## Community

Find me in the Vancouver design &amp; development community helping organize the
bi-monthly [Style & Class][style-class] meetup as well as the yearly
[SIAT Design Jam][design-jam]. I speak publicly, too, but I don&rsquo;t have any
videos to share with you. 😩

Of course, I also help run [The Nacho Club][nacho-club], where we review
the nachos of Vancouver. [The Mexican][the-mexican] is currently the highest rated.

## Right Now

- Seeking a full time position as a front-end developer 🤓
- Leveling up my JavaScript skillz 💯
- Organizing [Style & Class][style-class]&rsquo;s upcoming event 👀
- Redesigning my personal site 🤘
- Redesigning The Nacho Club site 🔑

If you&rsquo;re looking for a designy front-end developer for your product, you
can find me around the internets.
