Improving my JavaScript skills is important to me. It's like the English of
programming languages right now, so I'm glad I started my career out on the web
where JS was born. It is a very flexible language, and so there are a vast
number of utilities and frameworks created to support different approaches.

With all this going on, I have a basic problem: I haven't written enough
JavaScript to _really_ grok the context for the language's development. I'm a
relative noob in the JS world. I've been writing JS on-and-off for maybe 3
years, but it's only in the last year it's become a focus for me.

With that in mind, I decided to take Wes Bos'
[#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) coding challenge. It's a bit more
like a course, actually. It's like working through 30 days of exercises with the
solutions explained along the way. I'm documenting my learnings so I get more
out of it while also sharing with others. With 30 days of coding, I'll make 5
posts with 6 projects in each one, and a new post will be up every week.

Let's get to work!

## 1 - Keyboard Drumkit

This project maps the keys A through L on the keyboard to a corresponding drum
sound effect, and shows a visual key as feedback for the user. When a key is
tapped, a short transition effect gets played on the visual representation of
that key.

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="pRozGq" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="rowbot_weisguy" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Keyboard Drumkit" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy/pen/pRozGq/">Keyboard Drumkit</a> by Rowan Weismiller (<a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy">@rowbot_weisguy</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Here's what I enjoyed / learned from the project:

1. Use `forEach` to iterate through a NodeList, as was done with `keys` here
2. Prefer named functions for use as event callbacks
3. For data attributes, keep it simple! I don't always need to get the element
and search its `dataset` to take advantage of the selectors.

A nice easy start :)

## 2 - CSS + JS Clock

This project makes a clock using JavaScript's built-in `Date` function. It's a
bit simpler than the first project.

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="LxYPaN" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="rowbot_weisguy" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="CSS + JS Clock" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy/pen/LxYPaN/">CSS + JS Clock</a> by Rowan Weismiller (<a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy">@rowbot_weisguy</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

It wasn't part of the instructions, but I called `setDate()` once at the end
just to make sure the clock is correct on page load, rather than waiting a full
1000ms for `setInterval` to fire.

Here's what I enjoyed / learned from the project:

1. Using CSS transform's `rotate()` property can exceed 360deg and it will still
look normal as it wraps back around (i.e. 365deg looks the same as 5deg). Like,
duh, but I never tried.

## 3 - Playing with CSS Variables and JS

This project controls an image's styling with some basic inputs (sliders, color
picker) in order to demonstrate the power of CSS variables.

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="mRbWwb" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="rowbot_weisguy" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Playing with CSS Variables and JS" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy/pen/mRbWwb/">Playing with CSS Variables and JS</a> by Rowan Weismiller (<a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy">@rowbot_weisguy</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

I enjoyed this one because Wes took a moment to talk about a few small details.

Here's what I enjoyed / learned from the project:

1. Wes talked a bit about Node Lists, indirectly addressing the first comment I
made on Project 1. He explained that there is very limited functionality on the
NodeList's prototype, meaning we don't get cool functions like `map`, `reduce`,
or `filter`. When we need those kinds of functions, we can convert a NodeList
into an Array. I've done this before, but I wasn't sure when or not to do it.

2. This exercise actually use the `dataset` property of an element to access the
values of the data attributes on it. The difference between this one and the
first exercise's use of data attributes, is that accessing `dataset` isn't picky
about whether or not a certain data attribute is present, whereas the selector
predicts an element will exist with a certain attribute value.

3. CSS variables are accessible via JavaScript on any DOM node using `style`'s
`setProperty` method. In the following function example, we are listening to
updates on input elements, and then re-assigning a CSS variable on the document
root with the same `name` as the input, and using the input's value as the CSS
variable's value.

```js
function handleUpdate(e) {
  const suffix = this.dataset.sizing || '';
  document.documentElement.style.setProperty(`--${this.name}`, this.value + suffix);
}
```

Great stuff! I understand better now how CSS variables are better than the SASS
equivalent.

## 4 - Array Cardio

This was a pure JS exercise in array manipulation using higher order functions.

I loved it! It was quite fun. This is stuff I'm already getting a bit familiar
with in my work at Bench and often have fun solving.

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="RKbVgK" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="rowbot_weisguy" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Array Cardio" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy/pen/RKbVgK/">Array Cardio</a> by Rowan Weismiller (<a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy">@rowbot_weisguy</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Here's what I enjoyed / learned from the project:

1. There's a `console.table()` method that's handy for printing out arrays of objects, which is pretty common for me.
2. `Array.prototype.sort()` will automatically sort descending (for numberic arrays) or alphabetically (for string arrays) when called without passing any arguments.

One note, looking at this code example:

```js
const streetsWithDe = links
                        .map(link => link.textContent)
                        .filter(text => text.includes('de'));
```

That `includes()` function is available to both `Array.prototype` and
`String.prototype`, but it's a tad confusing that the `String.prototype`
implementation is an ES6 standard, while the `Array.prototype` implementation is
an ES7 standard.

## 5 - Flex Panels

This was a mostly CSS driven exercise with a little bit of JS for class toggles.

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="MJgmGx" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="rowbot_weisguy" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Flex Panels" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy/pen/MJgmGx/">Flex Panels</a> by Rowan Weismiller (<a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy">@rowbot_weisguy</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Here's what I enjoyed / learned from the project:

1. When writing something like `flex: 5`, it means that flex-item will take up
5x the remaining flexible space compared to its sibling flex-items.
2. Flexbox rules!

## 6 - Ajax Type Ahead

This project simulated the need to get results back from a search field for US
cities and states.

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="PWYmgR" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="rowbot_weisguy" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="AJAX Type Ahead" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy/pen/PWYmgR/">AJAX Type Ahead</a> by Rowan Weismiller (<a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy">@rowbot_weisguy</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Here's what I enjoyed / learned from the project:

1. Wes made a point about getting your data ready first before you start
worrying about how you'll render it. It reminded me of the kitchen principle to
have everything _mise en place_.
2. How to use the `RegExp` constructor in JS to dynamically create a regex with a variable term.
3. The UI pattern of highlighting the search term's appearance within the results.

That's part one! If you like what I'm sharing here, then I highly encourage you
to go to the [#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) site and sign up to get
this sent to you. It's a fun way to flex your web development muscle. Starting a
practice of coding every day is something I'm excited about.

If you do start, let me know! I want to cheer you on.
