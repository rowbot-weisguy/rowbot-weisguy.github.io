# About Rowan

Hello! I'm Rowan from Vancouver, Canada. 👋

I love the web. It&rsquo;s the open platform that has connected me with countless
people and ideas. Its potential gets me excited every day!

I&rsquo;m here to help make it even better by:

1. Delivering exceptional user experiences
2. Learning the possibilities and constraints of web technologies
3. Tearing down as many barriers between 1 and 2 as I can

## Background

I studied [interaction design][siat] at SFU, worked at [Mobify][mobify] for
over 2 years in an interdisciplinary marketing team, then left to work as a
contractor. Now I help clients make sure their designs got executed awesomely when
they get to the front-end dev stage.

## Community

Find me in the Vancouver design &amp; development community helping organize the
bi-monthly [Style & Class][style-class] meetup as well as the yearly
[SIAT Design Jam][design-jam]. I speak publicly, too, but I don&rsquo;t have any
videos to share with you. 😩

I also help run [The Nacho Club][nacho-club], where we review the nachos of
Vancouver. [The Mexican][the-mexican] is currently our highest rated spot.

## Right Now

- Seeking a full time position as a front-end developer 🤓
- Leveling up my [JavaScript skillz][js-project] 💯
- Organizing [Style & Class][style-class]&rsquo;s upcoming event 👀
- Writing for and improving my personal site (the one you&rsquo;re looking at) 🤘
- Redesigning [The Nacho Club][nacho-club] site 🔑

If you&rsquo;re looking for a designy front-end developer for your product, you
can find me around the internets.
